I started this entry on Friday December 6th, 2024.
It is now Saturday December 7th, 2024.
I finished up my practice assessment. 
I also made sure my notes were packed with as much information as possible.
On Saturday,
I finished my final assessment and quiz.
Im happy to report I got 100% on the quiz !
My assessment had 12 passing and 2 failing .
I had to turn in what I had just incase I cant get to it later.
Once im off work, My plan is to go back and get 14 passing. 
We are just working alot of overtime because of the holidays right now.
But my need for perfect score will be bothering me until I can fix it.
Its one of my best & worst qualities. 
I always strive for the best. 
I feel like a failure if im not there .
But im learning to be okay with just being okay.
Im proud of my self for finishing and making it this far!

until next time, Adios journal.
