Today is thursday november 21st 2024.
I am working on the 3 assignments Ray assigned.
The binary search practice assignment, the binary search tree practice. 
I also started the Binary Trees Long Practice.
I didnt quite finish it yet.
I will get it done tomorrow once I have more time.



Here is my Binary Search Practice code.

function linearSearch (arr, target) {
 return arr.indexOf(target);
};

function binarySearch(arr, target) {
let low = 0;
let high = arr.length - 1;

while (low <= high) {
  const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
  if (arr[mid] === target){
    return mid;
  }  else if (arr[mid] < target) {
    low = mid + 1;
  } else {
    high = mid - 1;
  }
}
return -1;
}




  // Set integers pointing to the high and low range of possible indices

  // While high and low indices do not overlap...

    // Find the midpoint between high and low indices

    // Compare the target value to the midpoint value

    // If the target equals the midpoint...
      // Return the midpoint index
    // If the target is higher than the midpoint...
      // Move the low pointer to midpoint + 1
    // If the target is less than the midpoint...
      // Move the high pointer to midpoint - 1

  // Return -1 if the loop exits with overlapping pointers




module.exports = [linearSearch, binarySearch];
