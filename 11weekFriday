On Thursday 11/22/2024, I worked on my canvas homework.
I kept at the binary trees long practice assignment.
I reviewed these links to learn more about binary trees.
Its something that is still a bit confusing so I just want to make sure I am grasping the concept fully

I also went over the canvas reading and I am going to review more over the weekend.
Im really excited to start the bubble sort .
